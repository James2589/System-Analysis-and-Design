# System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a learning project meant to teach system analysis and design. The client DriverPass wanted a system to improve driver education using current DMV regulations. The system they wanted was a cloud based web application with the ability to offer online tests and study material as well as make driving appointments with instructors online. The system also needed to support limited offline support so that the owner of the company could do work outside of the office.

# What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I did a good job of taking user requirements and translating them into a workable system design. 

# if you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The biggest improvement I could make is additon detail to support the decisions I made in my designs.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user's needs I was given an interview transcript, from there I read the transcript and took notes on all the functionality that was discussed. Once I had the basic functionality down I dove deeper into the interview to catch anything I missed and to begin adding in any small details that the client requested. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because this is their system. I dont know much about running a driving education company and the needs of such company. The client does, their needs tell me what the system needs to do. I can figure out the how but the what is something that I could only get from the user needs.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by first breaking the problem down into small pieces and then grouping things that work together to begin creating classes. From here I start with a UML class diagram. This allows me to get everything organized together and see dependencies within the system. Once this is done I can begin working on the individual functions to solve the clients problems.
